# MA204 Mathematical Statistics (Spring 2025)

### by Prof. [Guoliang Tian](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=tiangl&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2)

I took this course in Spring 2025, after completing [Probability Theory(MA215)](https://github.com/kaiiiichen/SUSTech-Kai-Notes/tree/main/MA215%20Probability%20Theory) Theoryh in Fall 2024, which is a must-learn course for the Class of 2027 in the Mathematics Department. These two courses are the most important ones for students majoring in Statistics, and they also provide essential tools and theoretical foundations for machine learning and related fields.

Mathematical Statistics is a subject built upon Probability Theory. Its foundation lies in the statistical philosophy that statisticians have developed over more than a century.

The core part of the course covers the fundamental knowledge required to conduct hypothesis testing—specifically, how to judge whether a hypothesis is sufficiently reliable and how to construct the (uniformly) most powerful test.

“Learning is a painful process.” This is not a lie. Although both the theory itself and the underlying ideas—or, one might say, philosophy—are fascinating, the long learning hours consist largely of tedious homework and calculations.

I have to admit that, in this course, homework plays a crucial role, as it provides many important complements to the main texts. Doing homework exposes you to situations that do not appear in the reading materials alone. Therefore, it deserves serious attention.
