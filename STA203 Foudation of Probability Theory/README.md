# STA203 Foudation of Probability Theory

### by Prof. [Zhuosong Zhang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=zhangzs3&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2)

Another undergraduate level course in probability theory but delivered through the statistics department.

I didn't take this course. I took [MA215 Probability Theory](https://github.com/kaichen2005/SUSTech-Kai-Notes/tree/main/MA215%20Probability%20Theory) delivered by the Math Department. 

All these metarials are collected by Prof. Guoliang Tian.
