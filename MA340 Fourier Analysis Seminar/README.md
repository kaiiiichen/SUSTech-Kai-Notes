# MA340 Fourier Analysis Seminar (Spring 2025)

### with Prof. [Pedro A. S. Salomão](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/salomaopedro)

This is the second seminar I took in SUSTech. It should have been a real course staff at the very beginning. But due to many reasons, it became a seminar.

We base on Stein's **'Princeton Lecture In Analysis I: Fourier Analysis'**

Listed above is the `.tex`/`.pdf` file of a small talk I gave on the seminar.
