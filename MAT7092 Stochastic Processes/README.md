# MAT7092 Stochastic Processes (Fall 2025)

### by Prof. [Wangjun Yuan](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/c/yuanwangjun)

It's my first time taking a graduate level course at SUSTech.

I skipped MA208 Applied Stochastic Processes (which is the undergraduate level course for Stochastic Processes and focues more on Markov chains) and MAT8030 Advanced Probability (which is the graduate level probability theory course) to take this course, with knowledge in undergraduate level prabability theory and some measure theory.
