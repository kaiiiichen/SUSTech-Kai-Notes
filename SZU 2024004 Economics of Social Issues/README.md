# SZU 2024004 Economics of Social Issues (Spring 2025)

### by Prof. [Ling He](https://eco.szu.edu.cn/info/1033/1144.htm)

I took this course as a general-education-level course in [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn) (Lihu Campus) in Spring 2025 as an "exchange student"([跨校课程互选计划](https://xfhr.utsz.edu.cn/)).

It's a two-credit simple course in economics, specializing in social issues, not requiring acdemic background in economics. You could see a branch of students who are really concerned about the society and many ideas poped up.
