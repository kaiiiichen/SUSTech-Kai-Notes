# CS217 Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (H) (Fall 2025)

### by Prof. [Pietro S. Oliveto](https://peteroliveto.github.io)

I'm having fun in this cource. The theory part is not that hard for me till now. But it's really a good chance for me to learn and practise programming in Python and C++ because I am forced to do the programming part of realizing the algorithms. Well, I have ever learned Java in Fall 2024, but I dislike the appearence of Java and I prefer Python and C++, which are more clear and intrigering. [ Well, I have to admit that I have fogotten many of Java's syntax:( ] And it's worthy of spending time on just making everything clear on the bottom of my programs and algorithms.
