# SUSTech-Kai-Notes

I started this repository in 2026. This is where I stored my study notes and materials during my study at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). I also listed courses I took delivered from other colleges/universities.

As a public repository, it guarantees that all the resources could be used safely under the lisence's protection.
