# SUSTech-Kai-Notes

This is where I stored my study notes and materials during my study at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). I started this repository in 2026. Courses I took before will be updated before the end of this year.

As a public repository, it guarantees that all the resources could be used safely under the lisence's protection.
